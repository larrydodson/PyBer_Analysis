# Background and Purpose
PyBer is a Python-based ride-sharing company, with ride data to be analyzed. The analysis and visualization results are to help executives with making business decisions to address the ride-sharing market-place requirements and in maintaining company profitability. 


## Purpose
PyBer executive V.Isualize has assigned staff to analyze the company's ride sharing data over a prescribed period of time, primarily January through end of April of 2019. The data includes cities, city types, dates of rides, ride-id's, driver counts, and fare information per ride. This information was to be analyzed and prepared using Python and Pandas to create a summary DataFrame, and Visualizations generated by plotting using Matplotlib in order to derive business insights and intelligence for decision making by the executive team.

# Results of Analysis

As was mentioned above, the raw data available from the provided csv files includes the cities, city types, dates of rides, ride-id's, driver counts, and fare information per ride. This was processed using Python Pandas and the following visualization graphics produced using Matplotlib. In the following graphics representations of the data, we see the below information, and can make these understandings.  
  - the total rides
  - total drivers 
  - total fares 
  - average fare per ride  
  - average fare per driver
  - total fare by city type.
